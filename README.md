## Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data to uncover trends and insights across countries and regions using SQL and Tableau. It demonstrates how to extract, clean, and visualize data to better understand the impact of the pandemic.

## Technologies
- **SQL Server (SSMS):** Used for data cleaning, aggregation, and querying.
- **Tableau:** Used for interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Key Features
- Aggregation of COVID-19 metrics such as total cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Trend analysis over time and across regions.
- Interactive visualizations for easy exploration of country-level data.

## File Structure
- `SQL_Scripts/`: Contains all SQL scripts used for data extraction and transformation.
- `Tableau_Dashboard/`: Tableau workbook and related visualization files.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
## Tableau Dashboard
An **interactive Tableau dashboard** was created to visualize COVID-19 trends and metrics:  
- Country-level and region-level trends of cases, deaths, and recoveries  
- Time-series analysis of the pandemic  
- Filters for countries, regions, and time periods

You can view the interactive Tableau dashboard here: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yousr.sahnoun/viz/CovidAnalysis2020-2021_17617402360080/Tableaudebord1)

## How to Use
1. Import the dataset into SQL Server.
2. Run the SQL scripts in the `SQL_Scripts/` folder to prepare the data.
3. Open the Tableau workbook in the `Tableau_Dashboard/` folder to explore visualizations.
